# AI Interaction Rules

## Language
- All code, comments, documentation, and commit messages MUST be in English
- Variable names, function names, and component names in English

## No Proactivity
- NEVER implement solutions immediately
- Always PROPOSE the solution first and wait for user approval
- Show the approach, explain the reasoning, then ask: "Do you approve this approach?"
- Only proceed with implementation after explicit user confirmation

## Small Incremental Solutions
- Break large solutions into small, testable steps
- Each step should be independently verifiable
- Propose a step-by-step plan for complex features
- Deliver one piece at a time

## Analyze Before Proposing
- Review existing code patterns before suggesting new ones
- Check installed dependencies before recommending new libraries
- Understand the current architecture before making changes
- Reuse existing patterns and abstractions when possible

## Verification
- After implementation, verify:
  1. Code compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
  2. No linting errors introduced
  3. Application runs correctly (`npm run dev`)
- Review code together with user before moving forward

## Scope Discipline
- Do ONLY what is requested, nothing more
- No over-engineering or "improvements" beyond the ask
- Respect the defined scope strictly
- Avoid adding features that weren't requested

## No Assumptions
- If requirements are unclear, ASK before implementing
- Do not assume technical decisions without user input
- Request clarification for ambiguous specifications
- Use common sense, but prefer asking over guessing

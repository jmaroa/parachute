Technical Challenge – Next.js + Cursor AI: “Parachute Trains” Puzzle

You are asked to build a small web application in Next.js using Cursor AI that visually
simulates and explains the solution to the “parachute trains on a railway line” problem.

Problem Description
A helicopter drops two trains, each on a parachute, onto a straight infinite railway line. The
distance between the trains is unknown. Both trains face the same direction. When they
land, each parachute detaches and stays on the track next to the train.

Each train is controlled by an identical microchip running the same program. The trains:
• Do not know their position on the line.
• Do not know the distance between them.
• Cannot communicate with each other.
• Can only: move forward one unit per time step, move backward one unit per time step,
or wait in place for one time step.
• Can detect when they are exactly at a parachute, but they cannot distinguish whether it
is their own parachute or the other train’s parachute.

Goal of the puzzle: Design an algorithm (the program inside each train’s chip) that
guarantees the two trains will eventually bump into each other, no matter how far apart
they start.

Your Task
Using Next.js and Cursor AI, you must complete the following:
1. 1. Model the puzzle
• - Represent the railway line as a one-dimensional line.
- Represent both trains and both parachutes on that line.
- Simulate the trains executing the same algorithm step by step.

2. 2. Visualize the solution
• - Show the trains and parachutes on the line in a clear graphical way (simple 2D
visualization is enough).
- Animate or step through the algorithm so we can see how the trains move over time.
- Clearly indicate when and where the trains collide (the successful end of the
algorithm).

3. 3. Use Cursor AI as your main assistant
• - You must use Cursor AI to help you design and implement the final version of the
application (for example, prompting Cursor to generate components, refactor code, add
tests, etc.).
- You may write and adjust code manually, but Cursor AI should be a key part of your
workflow.

4. 4. Original work requirement
• - You must not copy or adapt existing implementations of this specific parachute-train /
parachuted-robots problem from the web (Stack Overflow, blogs, GitHub, etc.).
- Use your own reasoning and your interaction with Cursor AI to arrive at the algorithm
and implementation.
- We may ask detailed questions to verify authorship and understanding.

What to Deliver
You must deliver a working Next.js web application (link to a repository is acceptable) that:
• Runs locally with a standard `npm install` and `npm run dev` (or equivalent) process.
• Includes a visual simulation of the puzzle and its solution.
• Contains a short README explaining: the core idea of your algorithm, how to run the
project, and how you used Cursor AI during the development.

# Clean Code Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each function, component, or module should have ONE clear purpose
- If a component does multiple things, split it into smaller components
- Keep files focused: one main export per file when possible

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or hooks
- Create shared components for repeated UI patterns
- Centralize constants and configurations

## Reuse Code
- Before creating new utilities, check if similar functionality exists
- Leverage existing libraries (framer-motion, lucide-react) instead of reinventing
- Build composable components that can be combined

## Keep It Simple (KISS)
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write code that is easy to read and understand
